# TwitterScraper
Twitter scraper made with node.js using twitter node client to handle requests. 

This is a simple twitter scraper. All you need to do is enter a search query to search twitter for and this program will automatically search twitter every five seconds, pulling down 100 tweets. 

The user must create Twitter app credentials to be able to take advantange of this app. 

It is my hope to integrate it into a larger web service to allow users to search for and save queries from Twitter.
